MBTA Train Times
================

This is a single-page web application that I wrote for an interview. Its purpose
is to simulate the giant train schedule boards and Boston's North and South
stations.

I figured it was a decent representation of work that I can do in a short amount
of time (this took about an hour to write) so I added some documentation and
tests and decided to throw it on GitHub.

## Running the Application

1. Either clone the application or just download it
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run `node server.js` or install nodemon and run `npm start`
4. Visit localhost:3000
